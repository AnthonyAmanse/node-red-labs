# Visual Recognition in Node-RED

Learn how to use Watson Visual Recognition to analyze images and classify objects, colors, and faces.

## Getting Started

Download and follow the lab found in [node-red-visual-recognition.pdf](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/node-red-visual-recognition.pdf).

## Code Snippets

JavaScript, HTML and JSON code used in this Node-RED tutorial is provided for your convenience in the following files:

* [1-list-images.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/1-list-images.html) HTML webpage that displays the list of sample images.
* [2-format-results.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/2-format-results.html) HTML webpage that displays the classification results.
* [3-recognize-objects.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/3-recognize-objects.json) JSON to import flow into Node-RED.
* [4-list-images.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/4-list-images.html) HTML webpage that displays the list of sample images.
* [5-format-results.html](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/5-format-results.html) HTML webpage that displays the face detection results.
* [6-recognize-faces.json](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/6-recognize-faces.json) JSON to import flow into Node-RED.
* [7-complete-flow.js](https://github.com/jeancarl/node-red-labs/tree/master/node-red-visual-recognition/code/7-complete-flow.js) Import this JSON into Node-RED to build the completed flow.
